# 2019: A Data Odyssey
### Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
### COE 848: Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Winter 2019)

## Description
Data and database management techniques are core to the effective engineering of scalable software applications. Rich data management schemes are needed to handle the sizeable Big Data that is available for processing. This course will cover related topics such as entity-relation diagrams, relational databases, data definition and manipulation languages, structured data representations formats, engineering of large-scale data-driven applications, development of novel vocabularies and semi-structured data and also novel concepts in NoSQL database systems.

## Project Components
Each student may choose any suggested project or define his or her own in consultation with the instructor. Suggested project outlines in areas such as web application design, mobile application development, embedded systems will be consulted with the students. Each component of the labs will work towards the completion and achievement of the larger course project. Requirement & Specification Document to outline the topic of the project and the module description should be included.

## Marking Scheme
1. Labs and Project 35%
2. Midterm Examination 25%
3. Final Examination 40%

*Remarks: The written reports will be assessed not only on their academic merit, but also on the communication skills of the author as exhibited through the reports. In order to achieve a passing grade in this course, the student must achieve an average of at least 50% in both theoretical and laboratory components.*
